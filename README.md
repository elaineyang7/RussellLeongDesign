# Russell Leong Design
Russell Leong Design is a design office based in the Bay Area that produces appropriate and meaningful brand identity graphics for a multitude of clients, small and large: high tech, and soft tech.

## Introduction
This is a project that I volunteered to build the design studio website for Russell. Currently, only basic HTML,CSS, and JavaScript are used to implement the UI/UX design, and then all components will be rewrite with React to make the code be reusable.

## The problem
The original website is a bit old and the structure is not so good. After our UI/UX designer interviewed people who used the old version of the website, the following questions were sorted out.

- Visual design is out of style
- Hard to find content
- Navigation is confusing
- Some content is not present clearly
- Inconvenient to contact the company through the website

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* BEM naming
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* grid 
* AOS - Animate on scroll library
* skrollr - Stand-alone parallax scrolling library
